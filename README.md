# TriangleModel_PyTorch
A modular PyTorch implementation of the Triangle Model [(Harm and Seidenberg, 2004)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-15929-005). 
- *model.py*: Defines a single "forward pass" through the system.
- *train.py*: Training utilities and ODE solver.
- *benchmark.py*: Runs phased training procedure. Saves losses / accuracies.
- *dataset.py*: Data utilities and tokenizer class.
